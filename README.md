#svpnssh (Simple VPN Over SSH)

Is a simple VPN over SSH. This project arises from the need to create a network connection using only SSH since the machine that the client provided us access to was in a DMZ that only allowed incoming connections on port 22 used by SSH and no NEW connections outward.
